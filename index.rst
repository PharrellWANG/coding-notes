Welcome to My Coding Notes
==========================
Testing the post-commit hook.....>>

This is a collection of *scattered pieces of coding notes* to
serve as memos. I share them with the hope that they *might* help
more *software engineers* or *programmers*.

.. code-block:: python

   from pharrell.coding_experience import i_will_update_coding_notes

   if i_have_something_new and i_happened_to_have_some_time:
      i_will_update_coding_notes()

You can type anything that you want in the search box. If my coding notes
happened to have something related, it will come up on the screen.
